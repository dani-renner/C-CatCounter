# Cat Counter  
## This project is for a prospective company
### My Instructions:  
#### 1.) Write a program in C++ that counts the number of occurrences of the word “cat” in incoming text. The program should support two text entry modes: 1) console input, and 2) file input.  
#### 2.) Write a unit test for your cat counter.  
#### 3.) Track your work in a Git repository. Deliver your answer as a Git repository on a publicly-accessible website (such as Github) or a zipped folder containing your git repository
